As one example, the word dumbed (as used in the accepted term "dumbed down") is not recognized. Would it not be a good idea to link these dictionaries in some way with a reputable dictionary? The Oxford English Dictionary would definitely be the best choice, as it is universally considered to be the "main historical dictionary of the English.

There's a lot of dictionary apps to choose from and I think this would be a great way to weed out a bunch of them.

Hello, I'm posting this after getting approval from LordQuorad. I'm promoting an App that I've just released today called JME. I started making it in April when the play store was pretty empty.

I picked up an Android device recently and I've been trying out a few different dictionaries. I looked at the older post regarding Japanese dictionaries for Android and tried out most of the popular ones but I'm looking for fairly specific functionality so that I can integrate the dictionary with other apps that I might develop.

Now that I've radically slowed down my WaniKani speed I have had some time over for programming and managed to clean it up enough to show it to you.
